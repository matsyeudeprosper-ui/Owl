"""ONE engine for the hedge rule. Every test imports this - nothing re-types it.

Three earlier scripts each re-implemented the same rule and gave $378, $598 and
a third answer on the same 27 months. The difference was a single line: whether
a new FIRST trade could open while the previous hedge was still running. The
$598 version allowed it, so it could hold three positions - which is not the
rule. This file is the fix.

THE RULE (user's, 2026-08-06)
  1. reversal -> ONE trade, 250-pt target, NO stop
  2. 150 points against it -> recovery
  3. take the NEXT OPPOSITE reversal - one only. Its target is 1.5x the first
     trade's drawdown at that moment; its stop is 1.0x that drawdown
  4. hedge hits target -> close everything, new cycle
  5. hedge hits stop   -> close everything, new cycle
  6. cycle P&L back to zero with both open -> close everything, new cycle
  7. NEVER more than 2 positions, and no new cycle starts until both are closed

TWO INVARIANTS, checked every run, raising rather than warning:
  - open positions never exceed 2
  - the sum of every cycle's P&L equals the change in equity
The second one already caught a different bug earlier today.

    cycle's own P&L reaching zero (or the basket cap). This removes the
