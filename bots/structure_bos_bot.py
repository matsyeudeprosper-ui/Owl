"""structure_bos_bot.py - the user's STRUCTURE rules, LIVE on real
account 223995441 (Exness-MT5Real30, BTCUSD, $7 spread).

DEPLOYED 2026-09-08 ON THE USER'S EXPLICIT DECISION with the
backtest evidence stated and accepted beforehand: over 69 days at
$7 spread the exact rule scored +$56 at 0.02 lots, INSIDE the
random-entry control band (-92..+113); the RR probe grid was
sign-unstable and its best cell collapsed in walk-forward (+176
first half -> +11 blind half). The user chose to forward-run their
exact rules anyway. Guard rails below keep the experiment cheap.

THE RULES (user 2026-09-08, verbatim intent):
  - the chart's structure engine IS the brain (silence filter:
    close beyond last shown high/low; swing dots confirmed only by
    full closes; 2-dot bootstrap; CHoCH then first fresh BOS flips
    the trend)
  - enter EVERY BOS of a confirmed trend, in the trend's direction
  - SL at the glowing dot; TP at 0.8 x risk
  - ONE trade at a time; base lot 0.02
  - fighters use available bullets: while there is a debt book,
    extra 0.01 lots ride along ONLY if the chest can pre-pay their
    full risk at this trade's stop distance (max +0.03). A losing
    fighter's extra share is paid by the chest; the base share goes
    to the debt. Wins pay the debt first, overflow fills the chest
    (cap $5).

GUARD RAILS
  - hard kill: bot net (banked+floating, own magic) <= -$60 ->
    close, stop, say KILL. Preregistered review at 100 trades.
  - honors owl_trading_pause.json for new entries
  - waits quietly while balance < $20 (account starts unfunded)

AWAKE GATE (user 2026-09-09, measured before deploy): entries only
when at least one trend FLIP happened in the last 2 hours. The
sleepy-market trades were the losers: gated backtest +207 over 69d
vs all-negative random controls (5 seeds), walk-forward winner
picked on days 1-35 scored +116 blind on days 36-69 (scratchpad
bt_chop*.py). Sleeping market = no fishing.
