"""owl_manual_trader.py - assisted manual trading on the LIVE account
(owner 2026-09-15, after the auto BOS bot was stopped on 223995441).

It NEVER opens a trade on its own. What it does:
  - runs the same Struct engine on M1 so the chart and the alerts use the
    exact structure the bot used;
  - pushes a notification on every CHoCH so the owner can decide;
  - keeps the debt / war-chest ledger AUTOMATIC by replaying every closed
    deal on the account, manual closes included, so the lot size the chart
    preloads always reflects the real debt;
  - publishes manual_state.json (trend, choch, debt, chest, net, lot rule)
    for the chart page;
  - executes an order dropped in manual_order.json by the chart, after
    validating it, and writes the outcome to manual_order_result.json.

Kill line: the ledger is reported but NOTHING is closed automatically.
The owner is the decision maker now.
