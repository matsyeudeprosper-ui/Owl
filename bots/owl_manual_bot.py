"""OWL — manual-trade assistant on LIVE account 134499778 (2026-08-20).

Jobs:
1. TP manager with RECOVERY system (user spec 2026-08-20):
   Golden rule: exit at NO LOSS or keep trades open. Never sets SL.
   - Single manual position (or any position not in recovery): TP = entry
     +/- $3-worth (dist = 3.0/volume).
   - 2 same-direction positions and the OLDER one is losing: newest keeps
     the $3 TP, older one's TP moves to its own breakeven + $0.10-worth
     buffer (never closes red; buffer beats the spread).
   - 3+ same-direction with multiple older losers: newest keeps $3 TP;
     older losers are PAIRED deepest-with-shallowest, each pair's TPs set
     to their volume-weighted midpoint + buffer so the pair closes together
     at net ~zero. Odd leftover -> own breakeven. Pairs are STICKY once
     formed (stored in state; only re-evaluated when a position opens or
     closes, so price wiggle can't yank a pair's TP away).
   - Recovery only applies when the older trade is in LOSS; profitable
     older trades keep the normal $3 TP.
   - Positions where the USER set their own TP (tp already set at first
     sight, or changed away from what Owl set) are left alone forever.
   Never opens positions. Never touches bot positions (magic!=0).
1b. HOUR-GROUP cleanup (user spec 2026-08-20, "yes build it"): every manual
   position belongs to the hour it was opened in (server time). When a
   group's hour is OVER, Owl checks continuously: if the group's total P&L
   (realized profits of its already-closed members + floating P&L incl.
   swap of its open members) >= +$0.10 buffer, it CLOSES all remaining
   open positions of that group at market ("OWL-hour-clean"). Group-level
   no-loss: an individual leg may close red only when the group as a whole
   exits positive. Below the line -> everything stays open (golden rule).
   The current hour's positions are never touched by cleanup.
2. Scribe: full market snapshot at ENTRY and EXIT of every manual trade
   (ATR14 M1/H1, EMA20/50/200 M1 + EMA20/50 H1, 24h range %, spread,
   M1+H1 candle anatomy, H1 higher-high/lower-low flags, sweep distances,
   duration, exit reason) -> owl_manual_journal.csv, entry_*/exit_* cols.
State (pending entries, assignments, counters) survives restarts.
