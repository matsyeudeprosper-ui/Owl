# Research map — what is open, what is closed

**Synchronised 2026-08-03 (task 006)** against the completed committed studies, which are
the source of truth. An earlier version of this file still presented perp-index basis,
broker feed lag and DVOL as "run this first" / "run next" long after all three had been
tested and closed. Anyone reading it would have re-run dead research. That is corrected
below.

> **Exactly one hypothesis is open: liquidation cascades (H4), and it is gated.**
> Everything else on this page is closed. Do not re-open a closed family "with a different
> indicator, parameter or timeframe" — that is the same test.

Read [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) first, then this file, then [`FINDINGS.md`](FINDINGS.md).

## The cost structure that shapes everything

Spread is a fixed $10 on BTCUSDm. What that costs depends entirely on horizon:

| horizon | median ATR | spread as % of ATR | history |
|---|---|---|---|
| M15 | $85 | **11.8%** | 1.4 yr |
| H1 | $383 | 2.61% | 7.59 yr |
| H4 | $798 | 1.25% | 7.59 yr |
| D1 | $1,727 | **0.58%** | 7.59 yr |

**Carry, measured and asymmetric:** `swap_long` = −1248.8 points = **−$12.49/night/lot
(−7.24%/yr)**; `swap_short` = **exactly 0.00**. Triple charge on Fridays.

**The FX equivalent, measured in task 004A across all 19 executable pairs:** wherever the
policy-rate differential says a side should *earn* carry, the broker pays **exactly
0.00%** on that side and charges the other. Any family whose edge is *holding* rather than
*moving* collects nothing on this venue by construction.

## OPEN — the only live question

### H4 — Liquidation cascades. **GATED. Do not run the outcome test yet.**

- **Mechanism** — a forced liquidation is not a trade anyone chose to make, so the
  resulting market order carries no information about value. Price may extend, revert, or
  merely become more volatile; those are separated in the preregistration.
- **Frozen rules** — [`PREREGISTRATION_liquidations.md`](PREREGISTRATION_liquidations.md),
  written before any outcome was examined. Definitions, thresholds and pass/fail are fixed.
- **Gate** — **≥ 400 independent cascades in development AND ≥ 100 in untouched holdout.**
  The trigger is the **count**, never a date.
- **Status at 2026-08-03** (task 006A audit, read-only, no outcomes examined):

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | Events captured | 2,947 over 3.22 days |
  | **FORMAL cascades** | **0** |
  | **FORMAL development / holdout** | **0 / 0** |
  | **Formal gate** | **CLOSED** |
  | Formal scoring begins in | **~26.8 days** |
  | Provisional startup diagnostic | 5 independent — **NOT gate progress** |

- **Zero is the correct formal count.** The frozen rule ranks each bucket against a
  **trailing 30-day** distribution; the feed began 2026-07-31, so no bucket yet has a
  complete preceding window. See Amendment 1 in `PREREGISTRATION_liquidations.md`.
- **No ETA is published.** Two earlier estimates were both wrong — "~85 days" used the
  *event* rate rather than the independent-*cascade* rate and ignored the holdout arm, and a
  task-006 replacement of "~340 days" was derived from a 3.22-day sample that cannot
  forecast a 30-day-trailing statistic. **The trigger is the formal count, never a date.**
- **There is no feed-truncation problem.** A task-006 warning that the OKX endpoint caps
  liquidation *events* at 100 per poll was incorrect and is withdrawn. `limit=100` caps the
  **outer instrument array**; one call returned **654 events spanning 22.6 hours** when
  measured on 2026-08-03. Commit `812ac5f` established this on 2026-07-31 and
  `recorder/derivs_recorder.py` documents it. **Do not shorten the 60-second poll.**
- **The two recorders collecting this are IRREPLACEABLE.** Their history cannot be
  backfilled.

### H5 — Open-interest change. **NOT YET.**

719 hourly rows (OKX caps backfill at 30 days), ~180 non-overlapping 4h windows. Far too
few. Revisit as the live recorder extends it.

### H2 — Carry asymmetry. **Not an edge in isolation; never to be claimed as one.**

Shorts pay zero financing on BTCUSDm and longs pay 7.24%/yr. That is a measured cash flow,
not a prediction. It is **~1/135th of daily noise**, so it is underpowered on its own and is
only meaningful as a tiebreaker applied to a rule that is already near-neutral. BTC also
appreciated across the sample, so a naive short bias loses on direction far faster than
carry can pay. Not a candidate family.

### Two things that measurably work — but not at this capital

Both documented in [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) §3, neither reachable at ~$1,000:
**delta-neutral perp carry** (needs spot+perp on one venue; Exness has no spot; premium
compressed to ~1–3%/yr) and a **diversified hold basket** (blocked by minimum lot sizes;
needs ~$13,200 at 1×).

## Standing constraint

The M15 bot is **authorised to trade on demo for forward observation, data collection and
execution validation. It is not authorised for real-money deployment, and is not considered
to have a validated edge.**

Its trades are forward data collection, not evidence. Two questions stay separate in every
report: *is the strategy profitable* (unproven, historical evidence negative) and *is the
live system executing its stated rules correctly* (testable now, and the point of the
exercise). Full constraints in [`README.md`](README.md).

## One distinction that must not be lost

A **current swap snapshot is not historical swap evidence.** Exness publishes no historical
swap rates and none have been collected, so no backtest in this project may charge or credit
a historical carry figure. Equally, measuring that this broker pays zero on V2's selected
side does **not** prove that every holding-based strategy on every venue is impossible — it
is one venue, one snapshot, one selected side.
