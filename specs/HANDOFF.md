# HANDOFF — read this before proposing anything

You are picking up a systematic trading research project that has tested **~20 ideas to
completion**. Almost all of them are closed. This document exists so you do not spend the
user's time re-running experiments that already have answers.

**Read this file, then `RESEARCH_MAP.md`, then `FINDINGS.md` (13 traps) before suggesting
a strategy.** If your idea appears in the closed list below, it is closed — including
"but with a different indicator/parameter/timeframe."

## 1. The one-paragraph summary

No systematic edge is findable on this account. That is **not** "no edge exists" — it is
that this instrument universe cannot *resolve* one. Three portfolio-level tests each
required an effect several times larger than the strategy family actually delivers in
reality. Two things do measurably work — delta-neutral perp carry, and a diversified hold
basket — and neither is reachable with the user's capital (~$1,000). **Capital, not
strategy, is the binding constraint.**

## 2. CLOSED — do not re-open without new information

| hypothesis | verdict | where |
|---|---|---|
| Price/OHLC/indicator timing on BTC (15 tests) | null | `mt5_ohlc_hypothesis_closed` |
| Funding rate as a DIRECTION signal | null | `funding_edge.py`, `funding_phases.py` |
| COT positioning as a direction signal | died out-of-sample on 20 unseen markets | `cot_*.py` |
| Basis / spot-perp spread | null | `basis_edge.py` |
| Broker feed lag / latency arb | null on all 4 preregistered criteria | `broker_lag2.py` |
| DVOL (all 4 preregistered questions) | null; Q2 died out-of-sample | `dvol_*.py` |
| Order-book imbalance | **REAL but 5x too small** — $2.04 move vs $10 cost | `orderflow_concentration.py` |
| Stop/target geometry search (30 shapes) | all tied; loss = the spread | `sim_variants.py` |
| Cross-sectional momentum, 19 US stocks | null, MDE 1.47%/rebalance | `xs_momentum.py` |
| Cross-sectional momentum, 57 crypto perps | null, MDE 3.23%/rebalance | `xs_crypto.py` |
| Trend following, 13 instruments | **underpowered, NOT disproven** — MDE 10.2%/yr | `trend_following.py` |
| **FX cross-sectional momentum 3M-1M V1** | **FAILED** 5/13; −$75.94, PF 0.529, p 0.7286 | `fx_momentum_v1.py` |
| **FX policy-rate differential V2** | **FAILED** 6/16; −$49.93, PF 0.826, p 0.5525 | `fx_policy_differential_v2.py` |
| The demo↔live mirror as a money-maker | arithmetic: costs 2 spreads, cannot win | `KLMirror.mq5` header |

**On the two FX families:** both were preregistered and frozen by the strategy lead, and both
failed on *direction*, not cost — doubling every spread moved V1 by ~$1 and V2 by $5.54. V2
additionally established that **this broker pays exactly 0.00% carry on the side a
policy-differential signal selects**, across all 19 executable pairs, so a carry-shaped
family collects nothing here by construction. Full detail in `FINDINGS.md`.

### The order-book one deserves emphasis
It is the **only** signal in the project that beat its error bar on the Exness feed
(53.5% vs 47.3% up-rate at 30s, non-overlapping windows, 54k samples). It is closed **by
magnitude, not by sample size** — a $2 move cannot pay a $10 round trip. Concentrating on
the most extreme books makes it *worse* (up-rate falls to 47.7% at the top 1%). Cost cannot
be cut: Exness Standard $10, Exness Zero for BTCUSD $8.75, Pepperstone $10–20, OKX perp
$63 (percentage fees on a $63k notional are brutal). **Do not propose "collect more data
and re-test."** That is the answer to a null, not to a measured effect that is 5x too small.

## 3. WORKS — but not at this capital

**Delta-neutral perp carry** (`carry_test.py`, 7.25 yrs Deribit BTC+ETH)
- funding alone: BTC +7.82%/yr — *the number people quote*
- naked short (no spot leg — what Exness gives): **−145.74%/yr**
- delta-neutral (short perp + hold spot): **+7.80%/yr**, positive in 7 of 8 years
- **The premium has compressed**: last 12 months +3.13%, last 6 months **+0.73%**
- Needs spot+perp on one venue. **Exness has no spot.** Unmodelled: exchange counterparty
  risk (FTX), liquidation risk, basis tracking error.

**Diversified hold basket** (`portfolio_hold.py`, `portfolio_honesty.py`)
- equal weight 1x: 15.0%/yr, 32% max DD, Sharpe 0.70 — vs BTC alone 19.4%/yr, 78% DD, 0.27
- **The robust part is return-per-drawdown**, which follows from correlations < 1 and does
  not depend on the period.
- **The return is NOT robust.** No holdout, no control. The two halves of the window differ
  by 2x (+8.9% vs +17.7%/yr). 16% of 1-year windows lost money. The Nikkei once took 34
  years to recover and JP225 is the top-ranked instrument here.
- **BLOCKED BY MINIMUM LOT SIZES** (`portfolio_feasibility.py`): JP225 min lot is 3.00 =
  **$188,684** notional. The 8-name basket ex-JP225 needs **~$13,200** at 1x. At $1,000
  exactly ONE name fits — UK100, which returned 0.2%/yr.

## 4. STILL OPEN — the only genuinely live question

**Liquidation cascades.** Preregistered in `PREREGISTRATION_liquidations.md`, gated at
**≥400 independent cascades in development AND ≥100 in untouched holdout**. The gate exists
specifically so an underpowered null cannot be mistaken for a finding — the error already
made once on the crowding branch. **Do not run the outcome test before the gate.** The two
recorders collecting it are IRREPLACEABLE; their history cannot be backfilled.

**Status at 2026-08-03** (task 006A read-only audit, no outcomes examined):

| | |
|---|---|
| Events captured | 2,947 over 3.22 days |
| **FORMAL cascades** | **0** |
| **FORMAL development / holdout** | **0 / 0** |
| **Formal gate** | **CLOSED** |
| Formal scoring begins in | **~26.8 days** |
| Provisional startup diagnostic | 5 independent — **NOT gate progress** |

**The formal count is zero and that is correct, not pessimism.** The frozen definition ranks
each bucket against a **trailing 30-day** distribution. The feed began 2026-07-31, so no
bucket yet has a complete preceding window and none can be scored as the preregistration
requires. See Amendment 1 in `PREREGISTRATION_liquidations.md`.

**An earlier version of this file said "roughly 85 days out at 42.6 events/hour". That was
wrong** — it used the *event* rate rather than the independent-*cascade* rate, and ignored
the holdout arm. **A task-006 replacement estimate of "~340 days" was also wrong**, derived
from a 3.22-day sample that cannot forecast a 30-day-trailing statistic.

**No ETA is published.** The trigger is the formal count, never a date.

**There is no feed-truncation problem.** Task 006 warned that the OKX endpoint truncates
liquidation events at 100 per poll and called it urgent. That was incorrect and is withdrawn:
`limit=100` caps the **outer instrument array**, not the events inside each `details` array.
Measured 2026-08-03 — one call returned **654 events spanning 22.6 hours**. Commit `812ac5f`
had already established this on 2026-07-31, and `recorder/derivs_recorder.py` documents the
measured behaviour and paginates backwards with `after` as a safety net. **Do not shorten the
60-second poll interval on this basis.**

## 5. METHODOLOGY — the standards this project holds to

These were all earned by getting something wrong first. `FINDINGS.md` has 13 traps in full.

1. **Non-overlapping windows.** Overlapping shrank standard errors 5.3x here.
2. **Random controls, and trust them over the textbook.** On the 19-stock panel, random
   ranking produced |t| up to **4.1** at the 95th percentile — the usual |t| > 2 bar would
   have manufactured findings that coin-flip ranking beats 30% of the time.
3. **Compute the MDE before interpreting a null.** Three of the tests above are
   underpowered rather than negative, and saying so is the difference between honesty and
   a false verdict.
4. **Costs in from the start, never bolted on.** A fixed-dollar spread scales inversely
   with ATR; assuming a constant ATR-cost invents edge in quiet regimes.
5. **Judge money per trade, not win rate**, whenever stop/target distances vary. A 71.6%
   win rate in this journal LOST $20 over 116 trades.
6. **Two-sided rotation nulls**, split-half or date-split validation, never shuffled.
7. **UNITS.** Three separate 100x errors in one session: swap is per LOT while ranges are
   per SHARE (stock lot = 100 shares); `swap_mode` is POINTS not currency (multiply by
   `point * contract_size`); and `symbols_get()` returns **356** symbols while filtering on
   `visible` returns 174. Always convert explicitly and sanity-check the magnitude.

## 6. LIVE SYSTEM — what is running and must not be broken

- `live/daemon.py` — decision loop on the DEMO account. **`KL_PROVIDER=session`** is a
  USER environment variable so it survives restarts; the attached AI session is the
  primary decider, GPT-5 is fallback after 20 min of silence. **This requires a Monitor
  armed on `daemon.log` for `DECISION NEEDED|AWAIT_SESSION|ALL PROVIDERS FAILED`**, or
  handoffs are written and nobody reads them while every heartbeat stays green.
- `live/act.py` — the ONLY path that touches the demo. Hard demo-only guard; **never
  remove it**. `MAX_LOTS = 0.01`.
- `live/mirror_publisher.py` + `KLMirror.mq5` — mirrors demo trades to the LIVE account
  reversed, barriers matched by price and **shifted one spread** so both sides close on the
  same tick. Costs ~$0.20/pair at 0.01 lots. It is an execution log, not a strategy.
- `recorder/` — microstructure + derivs recorders. **IRREPLACEABLE.**
- Restart procedures: `RESTORE.md`. Restart the daemon via
  `Start-ScheduledTask "KinoliveLines Daemon"`, never a bare `Start-Process` — that drops
  the environment. Match `pythonw.exe` as well as `python.exe` when killing it.

## 7. Things NOT to do

- Do not propose a 21st indicator or strategy family for this account. The constraint is
  breadth and cost, not the signal.
- Do not present a backtest CAGR as an expectation.
- Do not point the user at copy-trading, signal groups or prop-firm challenges. They asked
  once; that request profile is what those operations target, and it was declined.
- Do not tell the user a strategy is guaranteed. Nothing here is.
- Do not remove the demo-only guard in `act.py`.

## 8. Communication

The user is not a native English speaker and has asked **three times** for plain, short,
summarised answers. Lead with the answer. Numbers over prose. Compress the explanation,
never the substance — a short answer that hides a problem is worse than a long one.
